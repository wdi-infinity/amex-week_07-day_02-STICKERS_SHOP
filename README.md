We want to build a program STICKERS SHOP to sell our awsome stickers, it needs to greet the user then ask how many stickers and wait for an input. Each sticker will cost `15`SAR It should print out a message that includes the quantity the user typed in, and the total cost with tax.

we also want to offer discounts for ordering a lot of stickers at once!!. So if a user orders 50 or more stickers, they should only be charged `10`SAR per STICKER. And if a user orders 100 or more stickers, they should only be charged `5`SAR per STICKER.

## Features Checklist

1. Display welcome message
